component mass_var
% Mass
% The block represents an ideal mechanical translational mass. 
%
% The block has one mechanical translational conserving port. 
% The block positive direction is from its port to the reference point. 
% This means that the inertia force is positive if mass is accelerated 
% in positive direction.
